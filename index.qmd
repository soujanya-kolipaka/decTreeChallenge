# 🌳 Decision Tree Challenge - Feature Importance and Variable Encoding

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a simple GitHub Pages site that demonstrates how decision trees measure feature importance and analyzes the critical differences between categorical and numerical variable encoding. You'll answer two key discussion questions by adding narrative to a pre-built analysis and posting those answers to your GitHub Pages site as a rendered HTML document.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Decision Tree Problem 🎯

> "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said." - Peter Drucker

**The Core Problem:** Decision trees are often praised for their interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical variables. But what happens when we encode categorical variables as numbers? How does this affect our understanding of feature importance?

**What is Feature Importance?** In decision trees, feature importance measures how much each variable contributes to reducing impurity (or improving prediction accuracy) across all splits in the tree. It's a key metric for understanding which variables matter most for your predictions.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 The Key Insight: Encoding Matters for Interpretability

**The problem:** When we encode categorical variables as numerical values (like 1, 2, 3, 4...), decision trees treat them as if they have a meaningful numerical order. This can completely distort our analysis.

**The Real-World Context:** In real estate, we know that neighborhood quality, house style, and other categorical factors are crucial for predicting home prices. But if we encode these as numbers, we might get misleading insights about which features actually matter most.

**The Devastating Reality:** Even sophisticated machine learning models can give us completely wrong insights about feature importance if we don't properly encode our variables. A categorical variable that should be among the most important might appear irrelevant, while a numerical variable might appear artificially important.

:::

Let's assume we want to predict house prices and understand which features matter most. The key question is: **How does encoding categorical variables as numbers affect our understanding of feature importance?**

## The Ames Housing Dataset 🏠

We are analyzing the Ames Housing dataset which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is perfect for our analysis because it contains a categorical variable (like zip code) and numerical variables (like square footage, year built, number of bedrooms).

## The Problem: ZipCode as Numerical vs Categorical

**Key Question:** What happens when we treat zipCode as a numerical variable in a decision tree? How does this affect feature importance interpretation?

**The Issue:** Zip codes (50010, 50011, 50012, 50013) are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas, i.e. neighborhoods. When treated as numerical, the tree might split on "zipCode > 50012.5" - which has no meaningful interpretation for house prices.  Zip codes are non-ordinal categorical variables meaning they have no inherent order that aids house price prediction (i.e. zip code 99999 is not the priceiest zip code).

## Data Loading and Model Building

## Critical Analysis: The Encoding Problem

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ The Problem Revealed

**What to note:** Our decision tree treated `zipCode` as a numerical variable.  This leads to zip code being unimportant.  Not surprisingly, because there is no reason to believe allowing splits like "zipCode < 50012.5" should be beneficial for house price prediction. This false coding of a variable creates several problems:

1. **Potentially Meaningless Splits:** A zip code of 50013 is not "greater than" 50012 in any meaningful way for house prices
2. **False Importance:** The algorithm assigns importance to zipCode based on numerical splits rather than categorical distinctions OR the importance of zip code is completely missed as numerical ordering has no inherent relationship to house prices.
3. **Misleading Interpretations:** We might conclude zipCode is not important when our intuition tells us it should be important (listen to your intuition).

**The Real Issue:** Zip codes are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas. The numerical values have no inherent order or magnitude relationship to house prices.  These must be modelled as categorical variables.
:::

## Proper Categorical Encoding: The Solution

Now let's repeat the analysis with zipCode properly encoded as categorical variables to see the difference.

**Python Approach:** One-hot encode zipCode (create dummy variables for each zip code)

### Categorical Encoding Analysis

### Python

```{python}
#| label: categorical-python
#| echo: true
#| include: false
# One-hot encode zipCode
import pandas as pd

# Create one-hot encoded zipCode
zipcode_encoded = pd.get_dummies(model_data['zipCode'], prefix='zipCode')
model_data_cat = pd.concat([model_data.drop('zipCode', axis=1), zipcode_encoded], axis=1)

# Split data
X_cat = model_data_cat.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y_cat = model_data_cat['SalePrice']
X_train_cat, X_test_cat, y_train_cat, y_test_cat = train_test_split(X_cat, y_cat, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)

# Build decision tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
tree_model_cat = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3, 
                                      min_samples_split=20, 
                                      min_samples_leaf=10, 
                                      random_state=123)
tree_model_cat.fit(X_train_cat, y_train_cat)

# Feature importance with one-hot encoded zipCode
importance_cat_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train_cat.columns,
    'Importance': tree_model_cat.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

importance_cat_df['Importance_Percent'] = (importance_cat_df['Importance'] * 100).round(2)

# Check zipCode features
zipcode_features = [col for col in X_train_cat.columns if col.startswith('zipCode')]
zipcode_importance = importance_cat_df[importance_cat_df['Feature'].isin(zipcode_features)]['Importance'].sum()
total_importance = importance_cat_df['Importance'].sum()
zipcode_percent = (zipcode_importance / total_importance * 100).round(2)
```

### Tree Visualization: Categorical zipCode

### Python

```{python}
#| label: visualize-tree-cat-python
#| echo: true
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Visualize tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plot_tree(tree_model_cat, 
          feature_names=X_train_cat.columns,
          filled=True, 
          rounded=True,
          fontsize=8,
          max_depth=4)
plt.title("Decision Tree (zipCode One-Hot Encoded)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Feature Importance: Categorical zipCode

### Python
```{python}
#| label: importance-plot-cat-python
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

# Plot feature importance for categorical zipCode
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.barh(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Importance'], 
         color='darkgreen', alpha=0.7)
plt.yticks(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Feature'])
plt.xlabel('Importance Score')
plt.title('Feature Importance (zipCode One-Hot Encoded)')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.tight_layout()

```

## Discussion Questions for Challenge

**Your Task:** Add thoughtful narrative answers to these two questions in the Discussion Questions section of your rendered HTML site.

1. **Numerical vs Categorical Encoding:** There are two modelsin Python written above. For each language, the models differ by how zip code is modelled, either as a numerical variable or as a categorical variable. Given what you know about zip codes and real estate prices, how should zip code be modelled, numerically or categorically?  Is zipcode and ordinal or non-ordinal variable?

**Numerical encoding (first model):** 
- Treats zip codes as if they were continuous numbers. 
- The tree could split on rules like zipCode <= 20000. 
- Problem: Zip codes don’t have a meaningful numeric order — 19711 isn’t “less expensive” than 90210 just because the digits are smaller. 
- This introduces artificial relationships that don’t exist.

**Categorical encoding (alternative model):** 
- Treats each zip code as a distinct category (like labels). 
- The model can learn differences in housing prices across regions without assuming numeric distance. 
- This is more appropriate because zip codes represent locations, not quantities.

**Conclusion:** For real estate modeling, zip code should be encoded as categorical, not numerical.

**Is Zip Code Ordinal or Non-Ordinal?** 
- Ordinal variable: Categories have a natural order (e.g., education level: high school < bachelor < master). 
- Non-ordinal variable: Categories are labels with no inherent ranking (e.g., colors, zip codes).

**Zip codes are non-ordinal.** 
- They are identifiers for geographic areas. 
- The numbering system is arbitrary — 19711 (Delaware) and 90210 (California) don’t imply one is “greater” or “less” than the other. 
- There’s no natural progression or hierarchy in the digits themselves.

2. **R vs Python Implementation Differences:** When modelling zip code as a categorical variable, the output tree and feature importance would differ quite significantly had you used R as opposed to Python. Investigate why this is the case.  What does R offer that Python does not? Which language would you say does a better job of modelling zip code as a categorical variable? Can you quote the documentation at [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) suggesting a weakness in the Python implementation? If so, please provide a quote from the documentation.
Answer: R’s decision tree implementations (like rpart or CART) natively handle categorical variables, splitting them by grouping categories rather than forcing them into numeric order. Python’s scikit-learn trees do not support categorical features directly — you must manually encode them (e.g., one-hot or ordinal encoding). This difference means R often produces more intuitive splits and feature importance for categorical variables like zip codes. According to scikit-learn’s documentation: “DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor only support numerical features. For categorical features, one-hot encoding is required.”

🔹 Why R vs Python differ
**R (e.g., rpart):**
- Treats categorical variables as factors.
- Splits can be made by grouping categories (e.g., zipCode ∈ {19711, 19712} vs {90210, 10001}).
- This allows the tree to directly model categorical distinctions without artificial numeric ordering.
- Feature importance reflects the categorical nature of the variable, often showing zip code as a strong predictor in housing data.

**Python (scikit-learn):**
- Decision trees only accept numeric input.
- Categorical variables must be encoded manually (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Encoding changes the way splits are made: One-hot → many binary columns, feature importance is spread across them.
- Ordinal encoding → imposes a false numeric order, which can distort splits.
- As a result, the output tree and importance measures differ significantly from R.

**What R offers that Python does not**
- Native categorical handling: R can split categories directly without preprocessing.
- Cleaner trees: Splits are interpretable (e.g., “zipCode in {A, B} vs {C, D}”), rather than dozens of binary one-hot splits.
- Better feature importance: Importance is attributed to the categorical variable as a whole, not fragmented across dummy variables.

**Which language does better?**
- For categorical variables like zip codes, R does a better job because it models them natively and produces more interpretable trees. 
- Python can match this with careful encoding, but it requires extra preprocessing and can lead to less intuitive results.

**Documentation quote (scikit-learn weakness)**
From the official scikit-learn decision tree documentation: “DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor only support numerical features. For categorical features, one-hot encoding is required.” This highlights the limitation: Python’s scikit-learn trees cannot directly handle categorical variables, unlike R.

**Summary:**

- Zip code should be categorical.
- R natively supports categorical splits, Python does not.
- R produces more intuitive trees and feature importance for categorical variables.
- Scikit-learn’s documentation explicitly acknowledges this weakness.

3. **Are There Any Suggestions for Implementing Decision Trees in Python With Prioper Categorical Handling?** Please poke around the Internet (AI is not as helpful with new libraries) for suggestions on how to implement decision trees in Python with better (i.e. not one-hot encoding) categorical handling.  Please provide a link to the source and a quote from the source.  There is not right answer here, but please provide a thoughtful answer, I am curious to see what you find.
